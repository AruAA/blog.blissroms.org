If this list seems a bit too long, that’s because I’ve listed all changes from May and June, since we skipped May’s Update post. We would like to express our thanks for everyone that helped add these features and improvements to BlissRoms!

Thanks for tuning into this month’s worth of updates. And before signing off, I would like to ask whether people would be more interested in weekly updates rather than monthly updates. [Please vote with this Straw Poll!][straw-poll]
