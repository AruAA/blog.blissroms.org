New blog == new content == more things to enjoy. So what‚Äôs new this month for Team Bliss?

# General

## New rules regarding Telegram

As the projects of Team Bliss grow, so does the community surrounding it. And while we are open and accepting to each and every member of our quickly burgeoning community, some malicious individuals have decided to exploit that aspect.

In the last couple of weeks, we have seen a lot of people not follow the rules and instructions posted on our website and Telegram groups. In particular, we have seen a sharp uptick on nasty behavior toward admins and developers, where users believe they are entitled to something from our team.

Our stance on this is extremely clear ‚Äì Team Bliss will not cater to rude people. If you are kicked or banned from our channel, you best believe you have been rude to us, a team member, or a member of our community at some point. Bans will not be reversed if the reasoning is just, so do not ask. Any attempts to circumvent the ban using alternate accounts will be reported to Telegram and all alternate accounts will promptly be banned as well.

Please be nice and don‚Äôt be rude. Thanks!

## Looking for server donations

Team Bliss is also on the lookout for server donations! If you or the organization you work with have some spare slots on your servers, please contact us to get things rolling. We may even display your organization‚Äôs sponsor logos as a show of gratitude! üòÄ

In particular, we are looking for build servers to set up weekly/nightly builds for our device roster and some infrastructure servers to help team processes, such as documentation and bug tracking. If you believe your servers are capable, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to us!

[You can email us here.][server-donation-email] Please include the phrase ‚ÄúServer Donation‚Äù in the subject so we can quickly respond!
