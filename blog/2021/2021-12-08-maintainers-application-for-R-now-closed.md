_Note: this post is for developers and maintainers looking to join Team Bliss. Users can disregard this post.

Hello! As part of our move to Android 12, we will be closing new sign-ups for the Android 11 (R) BlissRoms maintainer application. Anyone applied after November 1 2021 will be put on waiting list and will be reviewed when we will come back with a new maintainer program for Android 12, so check back here often and we will announce details once we have them!
